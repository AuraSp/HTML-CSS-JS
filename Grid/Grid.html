      <h3 class="h3">Handguns</h3>
      <p>Handguns are guns that can be used with a single hand, and are the smallest of all firearms.
        However, the legal definition of a "handgun" varies between countries and regions.
        For example, in South African law, a "handgun" means a pistol or revolver which can be held in and discharged
        with one hand.
        In Australia, the gun law considers a handgun as a firearm carry-able or concealable about the person; or
        capable of being raised and fired by one hand; or not exceeding 65 cm.
        In the United States, Title 18 and the ATF considers a handgun as a firearm which has a short stock and is
        designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand.
      </p>
      <p>There are two common types of handguns: revolvers and semi-automatic pistols.
        Revolvers have a number of firing chambers or "charge holes" in a revolving cylinder; each chamber in the
        cylinder is loaded with a single cartridge or charge.
        Semi-automatic pistols have a single fixed firing-chamber machined into the rear of the barrel, and a magazine
        so they can be used to fire more than one round.
        Each press of the trigger fires a cartridge, using the energy of the cartridge to activate a mechanism so that
        the next cartridge may be fired immediately.
        This is opposed to "double-action" revolvers, which accomplish the same end using a mechanical action linked to
        the trigger pull.
      </p>
      <p>With the invention of the revolver in 1818, handguns capable of holding multiple rounds became popular.
        Certain designs of auto-loading pistol appeared beginning in the 1870s and had largely supplanted revolvers in
        military applications by the end of World War I.
        By the end of the 20th century, most handguns carried regularly by military, police and civilians were
        semi-automatic, although revolvers were still widely used.
        Generally speaking, military and police forces use semi-automatic pistols due to their high magazine capacities
        and ability to rapidly reload by simply removing the empty magazine and inserting a loaded one.
        Revolvers are very common among handgun hunters because revolver cartridges are usually more powerful than
        similar caliber semi-automatic pistol cartridges (which are designed for self-defense) and the strength,
        simplicity and durability of the revolver design is well-suited to outdoor use.
        Revolvers, especially in .22 LR and 38 Special/357 Magnum, are also common concealed weapons in jurisdictions
        allowing this practice because their simple mechanics make them smaller than many autoloaders while remaining
        reliable.
        Both designs are common among civilian gun owners, depending on the owner's intention (self-defense, hunting,
        target shooting, competitions, collecting, etc.).
      </p>
      <h3 class="h3">Long guns</h3>
      <p>A long gun is any firearm with a notably long barrel, typically a length of 10 to 30 inches (250 to 760 mm)
        (there are restrictions on minimum barrel length in many jurisdictions; maximum barrel length is usually a
        matter of practicality).
        Unlike a handgun, long guns are designed to be held and fired with both hands, while braced against either the
        hip or the shoulder for better stability.
        The receiver and trigger group is mounted into a stock made of wood, plastic, metal, or composite material,
        which has sections that form a foregrip, rear grip, and optionally (but typically) a shoulder mount called the
        butt.
        Early long arms, from the Renaissance up to the mid-19th century, were generally smoothbore firearms that fired
        one or more ball shot, called muskets or arquebus depending on caliber and firing mechanism.
